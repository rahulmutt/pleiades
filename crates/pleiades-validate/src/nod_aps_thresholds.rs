//! Measured-basis ceilings for the `validate-nod-aps` SE-parity gate,
//! mirroring the measured-basis convention of `fictitious_thresholds` /
//! `eclipse_local_thresholds` / `lilith_validation`. Pinned in Task 9 from
//! the actual per-category residual maxima measured over the committed
//! 184-row corpus (`data/nod-aps-corpus/`, 2026-07-07), each ceiling set to
//! ~1.4× the observed maximum, rounded up to a clean value — replacing the
//! Task 8 provisional (deliberately generous) placeholders.
//!
//! Categories (see `crate::nod_aps_validation`'s module doc for the split):
//! `MEAN_PLANET`, `MEAN_MOON`, `OSCU_PLANET`, `OSCU_MOON` — mean vs
//! osculating (methods 2 and 4 both count as osculating), Moon vs
//! everything else (Sun and the eight classical planets). Sun ascending/
//! descending rows are excluded from these ceilings entirely: since Task 9
//! (§R8) they are asserted exactly zero (both engine and SE side) rather
//! than gated against a residual ceiling — see `nod_aps_validation`'s
//! `assert_sun_node_zeroed`.
//!
//! Metrics, per compared point (ascending node, descending node,
//! perihelion, aphelion-or-focus):
//! - `_LONGITUDE_ARCSEC`: wrap-aware ecliptic-longitude residual vs SE, arcsec.
//! - `_LATITUDE_ARCSEC`: ecliptic-latitude residual vs SE, arcsec.
//! - `_DISTANCE_REL`: `|Δd| / d_se`, relative.
//! - `_LON_SPEED_DEG_DAY`: `|Δ(dλ/dt)|` vs SE, degrees/day.
//!
//! §R2 note: MEAN_MOON's measured longitude max came in at 0.561″ — far
//! below the plan's 120″ Moon-mean-correction trigger — so that follow-up
//! does not fire; no `docs/follow-ups.md` entry is needed for this category.
