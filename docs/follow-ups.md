## FU-2: True (osculating) lunar apsides sub-project

**Status:** resolved (2026-06-30) · Implemented by `feat/true-lilith-osculating-apsides` branch (Tasks 1–8). `TrueApogee` and `TruePerigee` are now served release-grade by `PackagedDataBackend` via the `crates/pleiades-apsides` crate (osculating Kepler apse from Moon pos+vel+mu). Gated against Swiss Ephemeris `SE_OSCU_APOG` Moshier corpus (3177 samples, 1900–2100) by `validate-lilith`; gate parity as of 2026-06-30: max longitude residual ~306″ (~5.1′), latitude ~53″, distance ~1.6e-4 relative, vs ceilings 460″/80″/2.34e-4. Of-date frame = true ecliptic of date via precession + nutation-in-longitude only (no light-time, no aberration — geometric direction). · **Next queued:** equatorial/declination output for `TrueApogee`/`TruePerigee` (chart-layer apparent equatorial shipped 2026-06-30 on `feat/equatorial-declination-output` for release-grade bodies; apsides equatorial follows when their release-grade status expands). · **Build-env note:** the reference tool `tools/se-lilith-reference` (used to generate the committed SE_OSCU_APOG corpus CSV) requires `libclang-dev` + `LIBCLANG_PATH` to build Rust bindings to the vendored Swiss Ephemeris. This is NOT required to run the `validate-lilith` gate or build the workspace — the gate reads the committed corpus CSV via `include_str!` and never rebuilds the tool. · **Severity:** feature gap (now closed) · **Opened:** 2026-06-30

## FU-1: Latent geocentric-Sun aberration double-count in `pleiades-core` apparent path

**Status:** resolved (2026-06-30) · Fixed by `apparent_sun_position` in pleiades-apparent (cc575c04); chart Sun path applies aberration once (a6113705); eclipse delegates to the shared routine (70a2adf2); Sun golden tolerance tightened 26″ → 5.0″, measured residual max 2.83″ (eb4339f2). · **Severity:** important (accuracy) · **Opened:** 2026-06-29

**Where:** `crates/pleiades-core/src/chart/mod.rs` (~lines 304–313, the
`apparent_position::<_, EphemerisError>(instant, sun_lon, max_iter, query)`
call whose `query` closure re-queries the **geocentric** Sun at each
light-time-retarded epoch, while `apparent_position` also adds annual
aberration internally — `crates/pleiades-apparent/src/apparent.rs:31`).

**The bug:** For the **Sun observed geocentrically**, the light-time
retardation and the annual (stellar) aberration are the *same* Earth-orbital
reflex-motion effect (~20.5″), not two independent corrections — Meeus,
*Astronomical Algorithms* §25. Re-querying the geocentric Sun at `t − τ`
(τ ≈ 499 s) already displaces it ~20.5″; adding the annual-aberration term on
top double-counts it, producing a systematic ~+20″ error in the apparent solar
ecliptic longitude. (This is Sun-specific: for the planets, light-time and
stellar aberration are genuinely distinct — "planetary aberration" = both — so
the standard `apparent_position` is correct for them. The Moon should be
checked but is likely unaffected for the same reason as planets.)

**Evidence:** The `pleiades-eclipse` work (this phase) proved the *same*
packaged backend matches an independent Skyfield 1.54 + DE440 apparent solar
longitude to **~0.5″** once aberration is applied **once** (see
`crates/pleiades-eclipse/src/ephemeris.rs::apparent_sun_longitude_deg` and the
`validate-eclipses` gate's ≤1.0″ longitude tolerance passing on all 908
in-coverage rows). Meanwhile the chart apparent path is masked: its golden
fixture gives the Sun a **26″** tolerance
(`crates/pleiades-validate/data/apparent-goldens.csv`, ~lines 7, 29–33) and the
header attributes the observed ~15–25″ residuals to ephemeris-fit error. The
eclipse result strongly suggests much of that residual is the double-count, not
fit error.

**Impact:** Apparent Sun ecliptic longitude in chart placements is off by
~20″ (≈ 0.006°). Below the 26″ golden tolerance today, so no test fails, but
it is a real systematic inaccuracy in a release-grade body.

**Suggested fix:** Special-case the Sun so the aberration/light-time correction
is applied once (mirror `pleiades-eclipse`'s `apparent_sun_longitude_deg`), or
make `apparent_position` aware that for a Sun query the light-time re-query and
annual aberration are the same effect. Then **regenerate and tighten** the Sun
rows in `apparent-goldens.csv` (the 26″ tolerance can drop toward ~1″) so the
fix is locked in by the apparent gate. Verify the Moon path separately.

**Origin:** Discovered during `phase6-eclipse-subsystem` (merged as
`00166809`); flagged by the Task 10B and final whole-branch (opus) reviews as
explicitly out of scope for the eclipse branch.

## FU-3: Backend J2000 ecliptic frame correction sub-project

**Status:** resolved (2026-06-30) · Implemented on `feat/equatorial-declination-output` branch (Tasks B1–B7). All first-party backends (`pleiades-vsop87`, `pleiades-elp`, `pleiades-data`) now emit a **consistent J2000 ecliptic (both longitude AND latitude)** at the backend boundary. Previously, latitude was silently "of-date" (accumulated nutation rotation not reverted), creating a mixed-frame boundary that affected topocentric latitude accuracy. Changes: (1) reverted of-date latitude band-aid in SPK reduction path, (2) brought ELP lunar theory to J2000 latitude as well, (3) added keystone **`validate-frame-consistency` / `validate_frame_consistency`** gate (≥17 representative body/epoch rows spanning 1900–2100) to the release posture — this gate permanently pins the J2000-boundary invariant, (4) recalibrated topocentric latitude tolerance to match the corrected J2000 output. · **Spec/plan:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-backend-j2000-ecliptic-frame-correction-design.md` + `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-30-backend-j2000-ecliptic-frame-correction.md`. · **Severity:** accuracy correctness + frame consistency (now closed) · **Opened:** 2026-06-30

## FU-4: Chart-layer apparent equatorial of date (RA/Dec) sub-project

**Status:** resolved (2026-06-30) · Implemented on `feat/equatorial-declination-output` branch (Tasks 1–6). Chart-layer body positions now carry **apparent equatorial of date** (RA/Dec, true obliquity = mean obliquity + nutation-in-obliquity) for release-grade bodies. Built on the existing `pleiades-apparent` pipeline: equatorial is derived from the final tropical ecliptic position (after apparent-place corrections) via `apparent_equatorial_of_date(ecliptic, true_obliquity) -> EquatorialCoordinates`. Gated by two independent authorities: `validate-equatorial` (JPL Horizons corpus) and `validate-equatorial-se` (Swiss Ephemeris corpus parity). Backend-boundary mean-obliquity equatorial transform strings remain unchanged (backends still emit mean-obliquity equatorial for their own mean rows; the chart layer wraps with true obliquity). · **Build-env note:** the reference tool `tools/se-equatorial-reference` (used to generate the SE equatorial corpus CSV) requires `libclang-dev` + `LIBCLANG_PATH`. This is NOT required to run the `validate-equatorial-se` gate or build the workspace. · **Severity:** feature gap (now closed) · **Opened:** 2026-06-30

## Deferred minor findings from feat/equatorial-declination-output tasks

**Status:** mostly resolved (2026-07-01) — two items remain open by design. · Source branch: `feat/equatorial-declination-output` · Resolution: closing-follow-ups plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-01-equatorial-branch-followups.md`)

These were cosmetic or non-blocking issues discovered during the B-series (frame correction) and equatorial tasks. Each was explicitly deferred out of scope — do not conflate with bugs.

- **B3 — frame-consistency gate assertion strength:** → **Resolved 2026-07-01:** the test now asserts `rows_validated == 17` exactly (`validate_frame_consistency`). The proposed extra `|Sun-1900 ecliptic latitude| > 40″` GREEN assertion was intentionally NOT added — the Sun@1900 latitude sentinel already runs inside the gate loop and proves the latitude component is genuinely non-trivial, so re-asserting it in the test would be redundant (documented in a comment there).

- **B5 — `PrecessedEcliptic` rustdoc drift:** → **Resolved 2026-07-01:** the module, struct, and field rustdoc were reworded to "caller-selected frame (mean equinox/ecliptic of date or J2000)", no longer unconditionally "of date".

- **Task 1 — `composes_rotation_with_true_obliquity` test tautology:** → **Resolved 2026-07-01:** the test now asserts against independently pinned RA/Dec literals (captured once, hard-coded) instead of recomputing the expected value from the function under test; rotation-direction correctness remains owned by the sibling `solstice_point_maps_to_ra90_dec_obliquity` test.

- **Task 2 — discarded `true_obliquity_degrees` smoke call:** → **Resolved 2026-07-01 (by existing coverage):** `true_obliquity_degrees` is already exercised directly by `true_obliquity_is_mean_plus_delta_eps` and transitively by the equatorial composition / solstice / roundtrip tests, so a dedicated smoke test adds no regression surface.

- **Task 4 — SE gate report epoch-range typo:** → **Resolved 2026-07-01:** the `se-equatorial-reference` end-epoch comment was corrected — `JD_END_TT = 2_488_065.5` is `2099-12-28` (was mislabelled `2099-12-26`); the JD value itself was already correct.

- **Whole-branch review — duplicate ε₀ literals (opportunistic unification):** → **Resolved 2026-07-01 (partial, by design):** the bare `23.439_291_111_111_11` in `pleiades-houses/src/systems/mod.rs` (mean-obliquity lead term) and the `OBLIQUITY_RAD` cache in `pleiades-eclipse/src/geometry.rs` now derive from `pleiades_types::OBLIQUITY_J2000_DEG`. The of-date polynomial at `pleiades-eclipse/src/geometry.rs:399` (`23.439_291 - 0.013_004_2 * t`) was **left untouched by design** — it is a distinct of-date IAU coefficient series, not the J2000 constant, so folding it into `OBLIQUITY_J2000_DEG` would be incorrect.

### Still open (by design)

- **Task 4 — SE ceiling raised for the Moon Moshier outlier:** The SE equatorial gate ceilings remain `4000″` (RA) / `1810″` (Dec) because the Moon's Moshier-vs-DE440 residual peaks ~2643″/1203″ at century edges (all other bodies stay <100″). The ceilings are **global** (apply to every body), not per-body — gross-error detection (~57× the ceiling) is preserved, and sub-arcsec per-body accuracy is the Horizons gate's job. A future ELP/Moshier accuracy improvement could let them tighten. **Remains open.**

- **Whole-branch review — ELP raw backend equatorial is intentionally of-date:** The ELP backend emits a J2000 `ecliptic` but derives its `equatorial` from the raw of-date lon/lat (preserving prior mean-mode values), so a direct ELP consumer who self-converts the J2000 ecliptic with mean obliquity will not reproduce the provided equatorial. Coherent and test-asserted (`assert_ne!`), and overridden by the chart layer for apparent bodies. **Remains open** (documented for any future direct-backend consumer).

**Severity:** cosmetic / defensive hardening · **Opened:** 2026-06-30 · **Largely resolved:** 2026-07-01

## FU-5: SP-1 angles & sidereal-time deferred items

**Status:** resolved (2026-07-01) · GMST + equation-of-equinoxes duplicates single-sourced, a southern-hemisphere `validate-angles` gate row added, and a Porphyry high-latitude fallback `asc_mc` consistency test added.

Opened by the `feat/sp1-angles-sidereal` whole-branch review (2026-07-01). SP-1
shipped public sidereal time + the Swiss-Ephemeris `ascmc` chart points
(`AscMc`, `chart_points`/`chart_points_from_armc`, `HouseSnapshot::asc_mc`),
gated by `validate-angles` (armc/gast ~0.16″; geometry points <0.05″ vs SE,
`swehouse.c` ports verified line-by-line). All items below are non-blocking.

- **GMST/equation-of-equinoxes math is duplicated across crates (single-source seam):**
  `pleiades-apparent/src/sidereal.rs` `greenwich_mean_sidereal_time_degrees` is
  byte-identical to the pre-existing `pleiades-time/src/sidereal.rs` `gmst_degrees`,
  and the equation of equinoxes is implemented both in `sidereal.rs` and inline at
  `pleiades-core/src/chart/mod.rs:411`. The crates share no dependency and there is
  no cross-crate test asserting the formulas agree, so a future coefficient edit to
  one could silently diverge. Values are identical today and each is individually
  tested — no current numeric divergence. **Suggested fix:** have `pleiades-apparent`
  delegate to `pleiades-time::gmst_degrees` (or add a cross-crate agreement test over
  a JD sweep), and migrate the `chart/mod.rs` topocentric-LAST path onto the public
  `sidereal_time` during SP-2 (already earmarked as the consolidation point).
  **Related (not a defect):** the public `sidereal_time` consumes the `Instant` JD
  as-supplied (UT1-based, honoring the existing house-layer time policy — a Global
  Constraint), whereas the topocentric path converts TT→UT1 first; a caller passing a
  TT instant sees a ΔT≈69 s ≈ 0.29° offset. Documented in the module header and
  `docs/time-observer-policy.md`. → **Resolved 2026-07-01 (`4c79c6c2`, `bd0da1bc`):**
  the GMST polynomial is now single-sourced into `pleiades-time::gmst_degrees_raw`
  (unnormalized), with `pleiades-apparent`'s `greenwich_mean_sidereal_time_degrees`
  delegating to it instead of carrying its own byte-identical copy; a cross-crate
  GMST agreement test guards against re-divergence. The equation of equinoxes is
  now a shared `equation_of_equinoxes(delta_psi_deg, true_obliquity_deg)` helper,
  called by both `pleiades-apparent`'s wrapper and `pleiades-core`'s chart
  topocentric-LAST path, replacing the hand-inlined `cos(ε)` term at
  `chart/mod.rs:411`. Scope note: this closes only the apparent/time GMST duplicate
  and the apparent/core equation-of-equinoxes duplicate that this item targeted — a
  separate, truncated (linear-only) copy of the leading GMST coefficients still
  exists in `crates/pleiades-eclipse/src/geometry.rs` (`sub_shadow_point`); that copy
  was out of this item's scope by design and is left untouched. It is intentionally
  *not* a single-source candidate: it is a deliberately truncated constant+linear
  approximation (it drops the quadratic/cubic terms) paired with a mean-obliquity
  approximation, so delegating it to `gmst_degrees_raw` would change its output —
  it must stay independent.

- **Southern-hemisphere `asc_mc_from` branch is transcribed but unexercised:** the
  `f_pole = -90 - lat` pole-height branch and the vertex western-hemisphere flip in
  `crates/pleiades-houses/src/systems/mod.rs` are exact `swehouse.c` ports but the
  committed angles corpus is northern-only (lat 0/40/55/66), so the strictly-southern
  path has no gate row. **Suggested fix:** add one southern-latitude row to the
  `validate-angles` corpus. Low risk (transcription verified). → **Resolved
  2026-07-01 (`10d71ec7`):** added a lat −33° / lon 20° fixture (`c5_lat33s`) to
  `se-house-reference` and regenerated the houses corpus (cusps/sectors/angles);
  manifest bumped to cusps=138/sectors=6/angles=6. This row exercises the
  `asc_mc_from` `f_pole = -90 - lat` branch under `validate-angles`. Corpus note:
  regeneration also canonicalized the row order of five pre-existing `Horizon` cusp
  rows (identical values, previously appended out-of-band) alongside adding the
  southern rows — no existing row value changed. Build-env note: `tools/se-house-reference`
  needs `LIBCLANG_PATH=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` to build and, from a nested git worktree,
  must be built from outside the worktree (cargo resolves the parent workspace root,
  which excludes the tool); the gates never rebuild it — they read the committed CSVs
  via `include_str!`.

- **`asc_mc` consistency test covers only one production site:** the
  `HouseSnapshot`-carries-`AscMc` test exercises the main construction site; the
  high-latitude Porphyry-fallback site is structurally identical and verified by
  inspection but not by an assertion. **Suggested fix:** add a high-latitude test
  hitting the fallback `HouseSnapshot` construction. Trivial. → **Resolved 2026-07-01
  (`5836ea13`):** added a characterization test that forces the Placidus-at-lat-75°
  `SwissEphemerisFallback` early-return branch and asserts the fallback snapshot's
  `asc_mc` equals an independent `asc_mc_from` recomputation.

## FU-6: SP-4 `swe_nod_aps` fictitious/small-body coverage bound

**Status:** open (by design) · Opened 2026-07-07 during `feat/sp4-planetary-nodes-apsides` (Task 6/7).

**What:** `EventEngine::nod_aps`'s `Osculating`/`OsculatingBarycentric` methods
are engine-covered for any body the backend chain can supply a state vector
for, including the SP-3 fictitious bodies and packaged asteroids. The
`validate-nod-aps` gate, however, has no committed Swiss-Ephemeris reference
rows for those bodies, so this coverage is exercised by unit/property tests
only, not by cross-checked SE parity.

**Why:** Swiss Ephemeris's own `swe_nod_aps` does not implement fictitious
bodies — the enabling branch for that body class is commented out upstream —
so there is no authoritative SE output to diff against. Separately, offline
backend chains (the packaged artifact, JPL/SPK snapshots) cannot supply the
continuous sub-day state sampling that computing an accurate osculating node/
apsis for a fast-moving small body needs; their fixtures are sparse
regression snapshots, not a continuous ephemeris.

**Impact:** No known correctness defect — `nod_aps` for fictitious/asteroid
bodies is exercised by non-SE tests and, where the backend can't honestly
support it (see FU-7), fails closed with a typed error. This is a gate
*reference* gap, not a behavior gap.

**Suggested fix:** A future SPK-at-runtime backend (continuous ephemeris
sampling) or expanded packaged-asteroid coverage with denser source cadence
could add SE-referenced rows for at least the asteroid subset. Fictitious
bodies remain permanently gate-unreferenced unless a non-SE authoritative
source is adopted for them.

**Severity:** known gap (documented, not blocking) · **Opened:** 2026-07-07

## FU-7: Pre-existing asteroid ephemeris-derivative defects surfaced by SP-4

**Status:** open · Opened 2026-07-07, surfaced (not introduced) by
`feat/sp4-planetary-nodes-apsides` Task 6. Pre-existing in
`crates/pleiades-jpl`'s `JplSnapshotBackend` and the packaged asteroid
artifact.

**What:** Two independent, pre-existing defects in asteroid velocity
derivatives, both surfaced because `nod_aps`'s osculating path is the first
consumer to finite-difference these positions for a Kepler-element fit:

1. `JplSnapshotBackend`'s sparse regression fixtures produce non-physical
   finite-difference velocities when the bracketing epochs are widely spaced
   (e.g. Ceres), which can manifest as a spurious `UnboundOrbit` when fit to
   Kepler elements.
2. The packaged artifact's `asteroid:433-Eros` fit has accurate *positions*
   at its sample epochs, but a non-physical time-derivative: its ~180-day
   source sampling cadence undersamples Eros's ~643-day orbit, so any
   consumer that finite-differences the packaged position (not just
   `nod_aps`) gets a garbage velocity.

**Impact:** Both currently manifest as `nod_aps` failing closed with a typed
error for the affected bodies/epochs — correct, safe behavior, not silent
wrong output. But the underlying backends' velocity/derivative output is
dishonest for any other present or future consumer that differentiates
position.

**Suggested fix:** Make `JplSnapshotBackend` and the packaged asteroid
artifact's derivative output honest — either by densifying the source
sampling cadence (Eros) / regression fixture epoch spacing (Ceres), or by
having those backends explicitly decline to serve a derivative/motion
request when the sampling cadence can't support it, rather than returning a
numerically-derived but physically nonsensical value.

## FU-8: `nod_aps` engine emits NaN (not a typed error) on non-physical r≈0 geometry

**Status:** open · Opened 2026-07-07, surfaced by the SP-4 final whole-branch
review. In `crates/pleiades-events/src/nod_aps.rs`.

**What:** `cartesian_to_raw`'s `(z / r).asin()` is unclamped and `aberrate`'s
`1 / norm(...)` is unguarded, so a geocentric point at r≈0 would yield a NaN
longitude/latitude rather than a typed `EventError`. (This mirrors the existing
unclamped house style in `pleiades-apsides::to_ecliptic`.)

**Impact:** Not reachable for any in-scope body — geocentric distances are
always physical AU-scale — and any NaN that did occur is currently caught
fail-closed at the gate boundary by Tier-1's `is_finite` check. So there is no
wrong output today; the gap is that the *public engine API* itself is not
fail-closed for this hypothetical, relying on the gate as the backstop.

**Suggested fix:** Add a defensive finite/`r > 0` check inside `nod_aps`
(or clamp the `asin` argument and guard the `aberrate` normalization) so the
engine returns a typed `DegenerateNodAps`/`NonFinite`-class error at the source
rather than propagating a NaN.

**Severity:** robustness / API fail-closed hardening (not reachable in scope) ·
